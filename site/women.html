        <p class="description">Dating’s always been a bit of a difficult sport. And, if it’s new to you, online dating
            can be even trickier. We all approach it differently, but here are a few tips for women that I hope might
            help guide you in how to date, from a man’s perspective.</p>

        <pre class="tips">
<b>It’s always best to be yourself</b> 
Yes, it’s advice we’ve all received. But it rings true now more than ever. We all feel tempted, from time to time, 
to pretend we’re interested in things we’re not, or even that we’re something we’re not. But
from the get-go, you’re much better off just relaxing and letting your date like you for who 
you are. It’ll cause a lot fewer problems down the line (especially when you have to come good 
on your claim of being a chilli vodka aficionado. A memorable experience…). And after all, 
everybody’s more attractive when they’re relaxed.
            
             
            
<b>Go in with an open mind</b>
The world would be a much better place if we all listened to one another and kept open minds. 
The dating world’s no exception. If you really listen to your date – asking questions and 
showing that you’re interested – there’s a much better chance that they’ll do the same. Which 
has the additional benefit of letting you work out whether you’re compatible much earlier on!
            
             
            
<b>Be prepared for an awkward moment</b>
We might go to great lengths to come off as confident, but most men (if they’re anything like 
me) are secretly suffering from first date nerves. So it’s always nice to plan an ice-breaker.
If you’re struggling for ideas, have a read of our first date questions. Personally, I like 
to ask what someone’s favourite childhood TV show was – and if they judge me for being a 
Scooby Doo fan!
            
             
            
<b>Avoid playing games</b>
My least favourite part of dating can be summed up in one word: games. Both men and women 
can definitely be guilty of this – but games are simply better avoided. Being genuine about 
your feelings and intentions will set both of you more at ease. I’ve lost count of the times 
I’ve told friends to just tell the truth – pretending not to be too into someone so they’ll 
like you more rarely works out in the long run.
            
             
            
<b>Most importantly, have fun</b>
I’ll finish on a bit of a cliche – but it’s always worked for me: just relax and enjoy it. 
Being overly nervous and tense might have funny and cute consequences in films, but it doesn’t
work that way when it comes to dating. Leave your past experiences and preconceptions at the 
door, order whatever you like, laugh, listen and just talk about what makes you tick.
